# MVP Scope (Road & Building)

This MVP focuses on the minimal workflow for both road and building projects:

- **Roles:** Engineer/Technician (site), Project Manager/Boss, Accountant (procures and hands over materials).
- **Flow:** Engineer requests → Project Manager approves/rejects → Accountant procures/delivers → Engineer records delivery status (delivered/partial/not delivered) or resubmits if rejected.
- **Guardrails:** Early-reorder guard based on declared usage window; alerts to Project Manager + Accountant; manager must confirm overrides.
- **Budget:** Accountant tracks spend vs budget throughout.

See `workflows.md` and `release-plan.md` in this folder for details.
